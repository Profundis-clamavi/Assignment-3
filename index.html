            <h2>Do dogs know their name?</h2>
            <p>Dogs can recognize their names, but they don’t know their names the way humans understand them. Dogs
                recognize the sound of their name and respond to it accordingly. Dogs understand their names much the
                same way babies do. Dogs process language in a similar way that humans do, using both sides of their
                brain to understand body language, tone of voice, and context clues4. Dogs perceive their names as a
                command rather than identification.</p>

            <h2>Essential tips to raise healthy pets</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>Limit human foods. Too many table scraps can lead to weight gain. Be extra careful about people
                        foods like chocolate, grapes, raisins, garlic, and macadamia nuts, which are toxic to pets.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Don’t overdo supplements. Most are not well-studied in animals. Ask your vet before you give your
                        pet any supplement.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>See a behavior specialist. Veterinary behaviorists can help with issues like separation anxiety,
                        aggressiveness, or excessive fear.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Pay attention to your pet’s cues. Let your dog or cat tell you what makes them happy, whether
                        that’s
                        a belly rub or some extra space.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Why does my dog attack me?</h2>
            <p>Although it may seem like your dog is biting you aggressively or showing other aggressive behaviors out
                of the blue, most dogs only exhibit aggressive behavior for one of five basic reasons: Your dog is ill,
                frightened, possessive, showing dominance, or frustrated.</p>

            <h2>How to throw a birthday party for your dog</h2>
            <p>Pick a Date and Place: Choosing the right date and venue sets the foundation for your party. It ensures
                convenience for you and your guests and provides a safe and enjoyable environment for the dogs.

                Plan Activities: Organizing fun and engaging activities ensures that both dogs and humans have a great
                time. It keeps the party lively and memorable for everyone involved.

                Safety First: Ensuring the safety of all the dogs at the party is paramount. Supervision, access to
                water, and shade, as well as monitoring for signs of stress or aggression, are essential to guarantee a
                successful and incident-free celebration.</p>

            <section class="ui-grid-a">
                <div class="ui-block-a roundedSquare">

                    <p>Grooming small dogs is essential for their health and happiness. Due to their size, they often
                        require more frequent attention than larger breeds. Regular brushing helps prevent mats and
                        tangles in their coat, which can be uncomfortable and lead to skin issues. Small dogs often have
                        delicate skin, so use a gentle dog shampoo during baths to keep their skin moisturized and clean
                        without causing irritation. Pay special attention to trimming their nails regularly, as small
                        dogs' nails can quickly become overgrown and uncomfortable. Cleaning their ears and brushing
                        their teeth are also important parts of grooming to maintain overall hygiene. Small dogs benefit
                        from gentle, patient grooming sessions to keep them looking adorable and feeling their best.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="ui-block-b roundedSquare">
                    <img src="images/pexels-pixabay-46505.jpg" alt="short haired dog">
                    <p>Grooming short-haired dogs is essential for maintaining their coat and overall well-being. While
                        these breeds may not require extensive grooming like their long-haired counterparts, regular
                        brushing helps reduce shedding and keeps their coat shiny. Bathing with a mild dog shampoo helps
                        keep their skin healthy and clean. Additionally, trimming nails and cleaning ears are important
                        aspects of grooming to prevent discomfort and infections. Short-haired dogs still benefit from
                        regular grooming sessions as it strengthens the bond between owner and pet while ensuring they
                        look and feel their best.</p>
                </div>

                    <p>Grooming large dogs requires attention and care due to their size and specific grooming needs.
                        Regular brushing is important to manage shedding and prevent mats in their dense coats. Use a
                        sturdy brush or grooming tool suitable for their fur type to keep it clean and healthy. Bathing
                        should be done as needed using dog-specific shampoos to avoid drying out their skin. Pay close
                        attention to drying large dogs thoroughly after baths, especially in cooler weather, to prevent
                        skin issues. Trimming nails is crucial for large dogs to maintain their mobility and prevent
                        overgrowth. Additionally, regular ear cleaning and dental care are essential for their overall
                        health. Large dogs benefit from consistent grooming routines to keep them comfortable, healthy,
                        and looking their best.</p>

                    <p>Grooming long-haired dogs is crucial to keep their coat healthy and beautiful. Regular brushing
                        is essential to prevent tangles and mats, which can be uncomfortable for the dog. Use a
                        combination of a slicker brush and a wide-toothed comb to gently work through the fur, starting
                        from the tips and moving towards the skin. Bathing with a suitable dog shampoo helps keep their
                        coat clean and manageable. It's important to trim the fur around the eyes, ears, and paws to
                        prevent irritation and infections. Long-haired dogs may require professional grooming to
                        maintain a tidy appearance and ensure their overall health and comfort. Dedicate time to
                        grooming to bond with your furry friend and keep them looking their best.</p>
